## Installation
<p>
UnitDiskMapping is a &nbsp;
    <a href="https://julialang.org">
        <img src="https://julialang.org/favicon.ico" width="16em">
        Julia Language
    </a>
    &nbsp; package. To install UnitDiskMapping,
    please <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/">open
    Julia's interactive session (known as REPL)</a> and press <kbd>]</kbd> key in the REPL to use the package mode, then type the following command
</p>

First add the QuEra Julia registry via

```julia
pkg> registry add https://github.com/Happy-Diode/Miskatonic.git
```

For stable release

```julia
pkg> add UnitDiskMapping
```

For current master

```julia
pkg> add UnitDiskMapping#master
```

## Example
```julia
julia> using Graphs, UnitDiskMapping

julia> g = smallgraph(:petersen)
{10, 15} undirected simple Int64 graph

julia> res = map_graph(g, vertex_order=Branching());

julia> res.grid_graph
