# UnitDiskMapping

Please check the following examples:
1. [Unit Disk Mapping](@ref), which contains the examples in ["Quantum Optimization with Arbitrary Connectivity Using Rydberg Atom Arrays"](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010316):
    * Reduction from a generic weighted or unweighted maximum independent set (MIS) problem to that on a King's subgraph (KSG).
    * Reduction from a generic or square-lattice QUBO problem to an MIS problem on a unit-disk grid graph.
    * Reduction from an integer factorization problem to an MIS problem on a unit-disk grid graph.

2. [Unweighted KSG reduction of the independent set problem](@ref), which contains the unweighted reduction from a general graph to a King's subgraph. It covers all example graphs in paper: "Computer-Assisted Gadget Design and Problem Reduction of Unweighted Maximum Independent Set" (To be published).
